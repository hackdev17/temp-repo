	\chapter{Module 1 $-$ PLANTATION AND ADOPTATION OF TREE}
	\subsubsection{Introduction}
	\par Mangifera indica, commonly known as mango, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is a large fruit tree, capable of growing to a height of 30 metres (100 feet). There are two distinct genetic populations in modern mangoes – the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".

	\subsubsection{Fruit}
	It is irregular, egg-shaped fruit which is a fleshy drupe. Mangoes are typically 8–12 cm (3–5 in) long and greenish yellow in color. The fruits can be round, oval, heart, or kidney shaped.Mango fruits are green when they are unripe. The interior flesh is bright orange and soft with a large, flat pit in the middle.Mangoes are mature in April and May. The skin and pulp account for 85\% of the mango's weight, and the remaining 15\% comes from the seed

	\subsubsection{Harvesting}
	Red-yellow flowers appear at the end of winter, and also at the beginning of spring. Both male and female flowers are borne on same tree. Climatic conditions have a significant influence on the time of flowering. In South Asia, flowering starts in December in the south, in January in Bengal, in February in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and in February–March in northern India. The duration of flowering is 20–25 days for the Dasheri variety, while panicle emergence occurs in early December and flower opening is completed by February. The Neelum variety produces two crops a year in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, but it flowers only once in North Indian conditions. \border \newpage

	\subsection{PILIKULA VILLAGE NISARGADHAM} \border

	\begin{center}
		\img{.8}{Heritage/Plikula Village Nisargadham-2.jpg}
	\end{center}

	\par Dakshina Kannada district too is rich in heritage and culture. Spread across 350 acres, Pilikula Nisargadham offers an array of activities one can think of. Botanical Garden, Medicinal Garden, Guthu Mane, Pottery, Handloom,Blacksmith, nursery, and Folklore gallery are the few main attractions of the Pilikula Nisargadham. Dakshina Kannada’s economy primarily depends on tourism, agriculture, and its by-products. The region is bestowed with heritage, culture, and historical marvels. At Pilikula Nisargadham, after deep research on the village and cultural aspects, a heritage village is recreated. This heritage village facilitates the visitors on how the various activities like handloom, pottery making, black-smithy, stone carving, carpentry, and many other hand-crafted activities are performed. This gives visitors a first-hand experience of the various rural activities.

	\subsubsection{History}
	\par Established in the year 1990, Pilikula in Tulu means ‘Tiger Pond’ and is about five acres in area. It is the lake where tigers once upon a time used to come to quench their thirsts, hence the name. Tulunadu culture of Dakshina Kannada district is one of the exquisite cultures which is becoming extinct. As we walk in we will find a navigation board mentioning things to see in the artisan village-like beaten rice mill unit, oil extraction, stone carvings, black smithy, handloom, carpentry, cane, and bamboo handicrafts. The other arts and crafts include Pottery, Handloom, Wood Carving, Toddy Jaggery, Fish Net Weaving, and Jasmine Culture. Pilikula artisan village was established to protect and preserve the old age unique traditional art and crafts forms and depict them to the newer generation so that the tradition goes on. \\

	\par One of the traditional and hand-crafted processes of molding iron and steel to produce various domestic and agricultural equipment is Black Smithy. In this process, the metal is heated until it turns red and becomes soft enough, and is hammered to the desired shape.
	The most significant art of Dakshina Kannada is stone carving and sculpturing. Rich in natural rocks and stones, the district uses granite, soapstone, slate, and black stone for sculpting and carving the idols of deities and Nagas. \\

	\par \border Pilikula Nisargadham Village apart from the artisan village also consists of many other attractions like a boating center, a biological park, an arboretum, a science center, a water amusement park, and a golf course.

	\subsubsection{Notable places of interest $-$ Guthu Mane}
	\par An architectural marvel, Guthu Mane is a traditional house of the coastal landlords. As the landlords of the yester years are progressing or migrating to the city life, the legacy of traditional and cultural heritage homes is becoming extinct. Look for intricately carved interiors, wooden pillars, ancient furniture and artifacts, and brass and copper antiques and vessels which are noteworthy. A huge Guthu Mane is restored and reinstalled to educate the visitors about the tradition, heritage, and culture of the region. The house also exhibits the dance forms, traditional attire, and other forms of folk arts and folk sports like Kambala, Yakshagana, etc. \\

	\par The architecture of these homes followed Vastu principles. Guthu houses look like a mini temple from the outside. Characterised by sloping roofs with Mangalore tiles and huge courtyards that overlook paddy fields, Guthu houses are a reminder of a bygone era. They symbolised the wealth and prestige of the wealthy landlords who built these houses. Exquisite care was taken to ensure that not only did Guthu houses evoke grandeur but were also built keeping in mind Mangalore’s often oppressive heat and humidity as a coastal region. \newpage

	\par \border The open space in front of the house beyond the main gate, which was called jaal, would typically have a shelter made from woven dried coconut leaves that would serve as protection from the extreme heat. All Guthu houses had a veranda that acted as a sit-out and beautiful doors made from intricately carved teakwood or rosewood. Ornate and exquisitely carved wooden pillars adorned the interiors of the inner courtyard. These pillars upheld a decorated wooden ceiling, which usually had representations of mango and floral designs, foliage, and coin motifs. Solid wooden beams called jantis supported this grand ceiling.
